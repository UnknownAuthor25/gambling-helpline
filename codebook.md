|                                           | Emotional & motivational states                        | Emotional conditions or motivations of help-seekers at the time of contact.      | They often feel ashamed and anxious about their situation.                                                                                                  | 11         |
|                                           | Common presenting issues                              | Recurring problems (e.g., debt, relationship issues, relapse).                   | The most common issue is financial debt due to gambling.                                                                                                     | 7          |
|                                           | Expectations & goals                                  | How help-seekers’ expectations shape service delivery.                            | Some of them come to us for help because a family member is struggling with a gambling addiction.                                                           | 10         |

| **D. Information Gathering**              | Diagnostic information                                | Specific assessment/diagnostic data                                           | We usually begin by assessing the severity of the gambling addiction.                                                                                       | 8          |
|                                           | Contextual information                                | Situational data such as family, social support, financial context.             | Family support plays a big role in whether they can recover.                                                                                                 | 9          |
|                                           | Environmental safety information                       | Assessing whether the help-seeker’s living or working environment is safe (e.g., risk of domestic violence, financial coercion, physical danger). | Sometimes we need to check if their home environment is safe before continuing the intervention.                                                           | 9          |
|                                           | Barriers to information gathering                      | Difficulties or obstacles in obtaining necessary information.                   | Many are reluctant to disclose debts because of privacy concerns.                                                                                           | 10         |
| **E. Experiences with Communication Channels** | Effectiveness – Confidentiality                        | Perceptions of how confidentiality concerns and incomplete disclosure affect effectiveness in supporting accurate diagnosis and delivering a comprehensive intervention. | Sometimes they’ll repeatedly ask if it’s anonymous, if their information will be kept confidential.                                                       | 13         |
|                                           | Effectiveness – Digital                               | Perceptions of how current digital tools affect effectiveness by failing to adequately support professional therapeutic techniques, thereby limiting the accuracy and completeness of interventions. | We mainly rely on Excel, but there are still challenges in scaling this concept or making it widely understandable...Usually it is easier to understand if they have a bachelor's degree or above | 9          |
|                                           | Effectiveness – Multi-dimension                        | Perceptions of how helplines affect effectiveness by enabling multi-dimensional assessment through access to diverse information sources (e.g., emotional cues, contextual details) that improve accuracy and completeness. | When talking to a help-seeker, I pay close attention to background sounds. If I hear strong wind or ocean waves, it might mean the person is on a tall building or by the sea (not a safe place), which makes me more alert to their condition | 7          |
|                                           | Efficiency – Real-time communication                   | Perceptions of how real-time helpline channels affect efficiency, particularly in crisis situations. | Once a help-seeker expressed harmful thoughts through social media, we immediately called them back to quickly establish contact.                             | 8          |
|                                           | Efficiency – Supporting material exchange              | Perceptions of how the ability to exchange supporting materials through helpline channels affects efficiency in addressing complex gambling-related issues. | Sometimes they can’t explain clearly what kind of debt they have, but if they send us a document or screenshot, we can quickly understand and help them | 5          |
|                                           | Efficiency – Language & cultural barriers             | Perceptions of how language and cultural barriers among diverse help-seekers affect efficiency by increasing communication costs. | Sometimes the help-seeker has a strong accent, and if I can’t understand them, they might think I’m not taking them seriously                                 | 4          |
|                                           | Satisfaction – Comfort in communication               | Perceptions of how different communication modes affect satisfaction by facilitating comfortable and supportive conversations with help-seekers. | When the help-seeker stops replying, I like to use emojis to break the awkward silence.                                                                      | 7          |
|                                           | Satisfaction – Mental demands of real-time channels   | Perceptions of how real-time communication affects satisfaction by creating higher cognitive and emotional demands, sometimes making interactions more draining. | I can only rely on memory. If I try to write things down, I lose focus and fall behind the help-seeker’s pace.                                              | 6          |
| **G. Challenges with Current Helplines**  | Personal-level privacy protection                     | Difficulties individuals face in maintaining or negotiating their own privacy and confidentiality when using helplines. | Someone once learned my name and later found my Instagram account through social media search.                                                            | 5          |
|                                           | Institutional-level professional training             | Challenges related to whether the organization provides adequate, specialized training for staff to handle gambling harm interventions. | New colleagues often experience psychological pressure, feeling responsible for relapses and questioning their effectiveness, sometimes leading them to consider leaving the profession. | 13          |
|                                           | Technology-level challenges                           | Barriers and limitations in adopting or applying new technologies for helpline services. | With video, you always worry that someone might record the session and use it maliciously, like editing clips out of context. That’s really risky and dangerous. | 9          |
|                                           | Suggestions for improvement                           | Proposed improvements to helplines and technologies.                              | I’d like automated referral tools that save time.                                                                                                            | 10         |
